# `gonb-persist` - Utility package for persiting variables in gonb
## What does this do?
This is a very small pacakge that makes it easy to use and modify variables in a `gonb` ([github.com/janpfeifer/gonb](https://github.com/janpfeifer/gonb)) notebook.
## Why not use `github.com/janpfeifer/gonb/cache`?
The `cache` package is much better written than this. It has better error handling and is more customisable. However, I prefer this package becasue it is simpler to modify variables in multiple cells.
## How to use
First install `gonb`. Then have a look at `example.ipynb`.
